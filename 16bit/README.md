# 16 bit

Here we have some simple code running in 16bit and using some bios interruption

The `test_asm/` folder contains a simple program that will display some strings and hexadecimal values.

The `test_disk/` folder contains a program that will fetch two sectors from the boot disk and display the first 16bits of these sectors to the screen.

The `utils/` folder contains some utilities function like disk reading, string printint, etc.
